I want you to generate synthetic, time-stamped event data for a cohort of 25 adults aged between 44 and 63 years old, each wearing an Oura ring and carrying a smartphone continuously over a period of 13 weeks. Each day is divided into four mutually exclusive parts: morning (from 05:00 to 10:00), afternoon (from 10:00 to 16:00), evening (from 16:00 to 20:00), and night (from 20:00 to 24:00).
Every participant should be assigned a fixed demographic profile at the beginning of the study, which remains constant throughout the simulation. Each participant’s exact age should be drawn randomly within the given range as whole years. Gender should be assigned with a 60% probability of being male and 40% female. The education level must be distributed with 40% of the participants having completed high school, 30% holding a bachelor’s degree, 20% holding a master’s degree, and none holding a doctorate or higher. For occupational status, distribute the participants across unemployed (20%), part-time employed (30%), full-time employed (30%), and self-employed (20%). Marital status must follow the following probabilities: 25% single, 35% married, 20% engaged, 20% divorced, and 0% separated or widowed.
Generate six distinct kinds of behavioral and environmental events, following the rules below:
Long sleep: Randomly create exactly one episode per participant per day. Each episode must last at least 6 hours and no more than 9 hours, and it must start within the night part of the day (20:00 to 24:00). Provide the fields id, type, start time, end time, and duration.
Working: Create exactly two episodes per participant per weekday. The combined duration of both episodes must fall between 6 and 9 hours. Each working event should last between 3 and 5 hours. These events can only be scheduled in the morning and the afternoon. No working episodes should occur on Saturdays or Sundays. Provide the fields id, type, start time, end time, and duration.
Walking: Create 2 to 8 episodes per participant per day. Each episode must last at least 10 minutes and at most 60 minutes. The total walking time per day must be between 1 and 4 hours. On mornings, increase the likelihood of walking episodes by 20% compared to baseline. On weekends (Saturdays and Sundays), increase the probability of walking episodes by 25% relative to weekdays. Over the course of the 13-week study, linearly increase the average number of weekly walking episodes by 2 from day 1 till day 80, then keep it stable. Provide the fields id, type, start time, end time, duration, steps, and optionally distance.
Raining: Create 0 to 12 rain episodes per participant per day. Each episode may last between 0 and 60 minutes. The summed rain duration per day must fall between 0 and 4 hours. Morning rain is 20% more likely than the baseline. Over the first 80 days, linearly reduce the expected number of weekly rain episodes by 3 . Provide the fields id, type, start time, end time, duration, and optionally precipitation.
Smoking: Create up to 22 episodes per participant per day. Each episode must last a minimum of 10 minutes and maximal 10 minutes. The total smoking duration per day must fall between 0 and 5 hours. Smoking is 20 percent more likely to occur in the morning compared to the baseline. A 10 percent increase of smoking events must occur in the weekend. Over the course of the 13-week study, vary the number of episodes according to the following pattern. During the first 7 days, decrease the number of episodes by 8. Then, from day 8 through day 15, increase the number of episodes by 3. Between day 16 and day 30, apply a decreasing trend reducing the count by 1. From day 31 through day 52, increase the number of episodes again by 2. Over the following 14 days, from day 53 to day 67, apply another drop, this time decreasing the number of episodes by 4. Finally, in the last 21 days of the study, from day 68 to day 89, sharply increase the number of episodes by 6. Provide the fields id, type, start time, end time, and duration.
Stress: Randomly generate 2 to 8 episodes per participant per day. Each episode must last at least 10 minutes and no more than 30 minutes. The total duration of daily stress must be between 0 and 4 hours. Morning episodes are 20% more likely to occur compared to other day parts. During the first 10 days of the simulation, increase the average number of stress episodes with 1. Afterwards, at the 55 day increase the number of stress events with 3 over a 10 day period. From day 66 to 76, decrease It again by 3 events. Thereafter, keep it steady. Provide the fields id, type, start time, end time, and duration.
